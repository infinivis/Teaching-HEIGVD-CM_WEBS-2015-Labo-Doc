#### Why did we choose node.js instead of Spring Boot to build our API?
This course was the opportunity for us to write our first API or webService. But I've read a lot about new technologies, and especially on the rising tide that is node.js.

In our school program, there is two orientations which are IT Managements and more Media. The main difference is were we are situated on a project. The "ITs" one, are more programing on the server part, while "media's" one are more coding on the client side. 

As "media" guy's, we still have some server languages basics like java (that we learned to apply OOP), and php. But as a client "developer", we did a lot of javascript. 

I personally read a lot about topics dealing with javascript, and as I said before, node.js was the rising tide that I wanted to learn. My hunch is that javascript on both side (server-client) will be very important on the web. 

The fact that we have javascript on both side facilitates the communication between them. 
Javascript coding is asynchronous thinking, it means that we can have more then one task at the time runing. Performances are a bit better then the "old" languages, on big trafic websites/applications. 

We love javascript and it's potential is in our opinion really important. This reason, with the other one's, is enough to choose this technology.
