# Smart City - Citizen Engagement - Doc Skeleton

*Documentation of the API of the Citizen Engagement*

This is a generator that compiles [Markdown][md] and [RAML][raml] files into a
static site. The following [Node.js][node] stack is used:

 - Build tasks using [Grunt][grunt]
 - Content assembling with [Metalsmith][metalsmith]
 - Templating using [Jade][jade]
 - CSS-preprocessing with [Stylus][stylus]
 - Basic styling using [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap]

Note that apart from Markdown support within the RAML spec it also supports
plain `.md` files that are compiled independently from the API documentation.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

  - Make sure [Node.js][node] is installed and in your `PATH`
  - Install Grunt: `npm install -g grunt-cli`

  1. Clone the repo.
  2. `cd` the folder.
  3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
